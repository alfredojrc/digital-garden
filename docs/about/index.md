## Hey there! 👋

I'm a DevOps engineer passionate about building reliable, scalable infrastructure that just works. With over a decade in IT, I've gone from troubleshooting servers in data centers to orchestrating containerized workloads across cloud platforms.

These days, you'll find me deep in Kubernetes manifests, automating everything I can, and exploring the fascinating world of distributed systems. I believe in infrastructure as code, comprehensive observability, and the kind of automation that lets you sleep soundly at night.

When I'm not deploying to production or diving into storage architectures, I'm probably here in my digital garden—documenting what I learn, preparing for certifications (currently tackling the CKA), and sharing insights from the trenches of modern infrastructure engineering.

## What I Do

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-kubernetes:{ .lg .middle } **Container Orchestration**

    ---

    Kubernetes architecture, deployment strategies, service mesh, and production-grade cluster management. Currently leveling up with CKA certification prep.

-   :material-cloud:{ .lg .middle } **Cloud Infrastructure**

    ---

    AWS and GCP cloud platforms, multi-cloud strategies, cloud-native architectures, and cost optimization.

-   :material-code-braces:{ .lg .middle } **Infrastructure as Code**

    ---

    Terraform, Ansible, GitOps workflows, and declarative infrastructure management. Everything versioned, everything automated.

-   :material-robot:{ .lg .middle } **CI/CD & Automation**

    ---

    Build pipelines, deployment automation, testing strategies, and continuous delivery workflows that developers actually enjoy using.

-   :material-database:{ .lg .middle } **Distributed Storage**

    ---

    Parallel file systems (pNFS), high-performance storage architectures, and data management at scale. Fascinated by how data moves and persists.

-   :material-shield-check:{ .lg .middle } **Security & Compliance**

    ---

    Security best practices, RBAC, secrets management, network policies, and building systems that are secure by default.

## Current Focus

**:material-school: Learning**: Deep-diving into Kubernetes for the CKA exam—covering everything from cluster architecture to advanced troubleshooting. Check out my [Kubernetes CKA series](/kubernetes/) for detailed notes and labs.

**:material-sprout: Building**: Growing this digital garden as a living knowledge base. It's part technical documentation, part learning journal, part reference library.

**:material-microscope: Exploring**: Distributed systems patterns, storage architectures (especially pNFS and high-performance storage), and the intersection of networking and containerization.

---

## Technical Toolkit

**Languages & Scripting**: Python, Bash, YAML (does it count? 😄), HCL

**Platforms**: Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, GCP, Linux (CentOS, Ubuntu, RHEL)

**IaC & Config Management**: Terraform, Ansible, Helm, Kustomize

**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins

**Monitoring & Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

**Storage & Networking**: NFS, pNFS, InfiniBand, RoCE, CNI plugins

**Languages**: Spanish (native), English (fluent)

## Let's Connect

This digital garden is my way of learning in public and sharing what I discover along the way. If you're exploring similar topics, found something useful here, or just want to chat about Kubernetes, infrastructure, or distributed systems—I'd love to hear from you.
