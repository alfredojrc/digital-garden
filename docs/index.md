## Hey there! 👋

I'm a Senior IT Engineer with over 20 years of experience designing, building, and securing enterprise infrastructure across the globe. From troubleshooting network issues in Madrid to architecting multi-cloud solutions in Zürich, I've been fortunate to work with some incredible teams at companies like Roche, Swisscom, elipsLife, and Solera.

These days, I'm deep into AI and LLM technologies—exploring everything from prompt engineering with Claude Code and Cursor to building AI agent workflows with LangChain and LangGraph. I believe in infrastructure as code, security by design, and automation that makes life easier for everyone.

When I'm not experimenting with local LLMs or fine-tuning vector databases, you'll find me here in my digital garden—sharing what I learn, documenting my journey, and connecting the dots between traditional infrastructure and the AI-powered future.

## Current Focus

**:material-brain: AI & LLM Exploration**: Currently on a sabbatical diving deep into AI technologies—Python development, prompt engineering with Claude Code and Cursor, building knowledge graphs, working with vector databases, and deploying local LLMs. Experimenting with AI agent workflows and context engineering.

**:material-sprout: Knowledge Sharing**: Growing this digital garden as a living knowledge base. Documenting learnings about Kubernetes (CKA prep), distributed systems, storage architectures, and the intersection of traditional infrastructure with AI/ML workloads.

**:material-account-group: Community**: Inter-team collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mentoring. I believe the best solutions come from diverse perspectives and open communication.
