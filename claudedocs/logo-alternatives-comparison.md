- Curved connection lines with proper stroke caps
- 4 levels of hierarchy (root → branches → leaves → endpoints)
- Node glow effects for subtle depth
- Mathematical branching pattern following network topology rules

**Color Strategy:**
- **Nodes:** Indigo (#3f51b5) → lighter in dark mode (#7986cb)
- **Connections:** Cyan (#00bcd4) → lighter cyan in dark mode (#4dd0e1)
- **Glow:** Semi-transparent node color for subtle emphasis

**Strengths:**
- Direct metaphorical alignment with distributed systems content
- High conceptual sophistication appeals to technical audience
- Differentiates from generic tree logos
- Excellent scalability (geometric forms scale perfectly)
- Clearly communicates "technical knowledge structure"

**Ideal Use Cases:**
- Main site logo
- Technical documentation headers
- Blog post icons
- Social media profiles
